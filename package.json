  "description": "ASKL (pronounced 'ASKULL') is a beat-saber inspired game where a user has 4 sabers to control with the keys 'A S K L'. A randomly selected song will play and the user will have to hit the right key combinations that match the beat of the song to earn points. Users can be on a continuous point streak for not missing a beat. The rules are simple. Start the song, hit the right keys and make it to the end. Too many mistakes and you will have to restart.",
